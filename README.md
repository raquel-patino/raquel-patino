      <h1>👋 Hi there! I'm Raquel</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a fullstack web developer with a background in the tourism industry and quality management. After several years helping international teams optimize processes and performance, I discovered a real passion for solving problems through technology.  
        <br><br>
        I now specialize in Laravel, RESTful APIs, SQL databases, Docker, and frontend development with React and Tailwind CSS. I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning Python, especially for backend development and AI integration.  
        <br><br>
        I enjoy building clean, scalable solutions that make people's lives easier, and I love taking on new challenges that push me to grow. I'm especially passionate about combining my past experience in tourism with my current tech skills to contribute to meaningful, user-centered digital products.
